            My name is Amada Haro and this is my first time learning HTML and CSS. I want to create my own game for Windows and a few mobile apps. Soon I will be able to create my own webpages and possibly for other people. I am also a photographer so I would be able to use my own images to upload to the webpages I create. I also love to cook and try different types of food from around the world, my favorite is anything spicy! I have a dog named Harley and he is a maltipoo.
