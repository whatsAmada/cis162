            <h3>I have many hobbies, but my favorite one is photography. Ever since I was a little girl, I loved to see the images my mother took and the passion is saw in her work. I have always had an eye for detail and thought I should try it out. Once I picked up a camera, I never put it down! I have my own LLC and I am building it up.
            <p>
            Another hobby of mine is traveling. I love to see knew places and learn about the culture, taste new foods and just experience the world outside of mine. I plan on taking at least one trip a year if I can, while I am young!
